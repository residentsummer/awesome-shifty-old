This awesome awesome library provides means to dynamically assign tags to
clients. As for me, this feature completely changes the expirience of using
this minimalistic window manager.

Project was started at mercenariesguild.net (not by me, though), but last
commit was done in far 2009. So I thought, that adopting it will be a
valueable contibution for the community.

If you are interested in development of shifty, please contact me.
